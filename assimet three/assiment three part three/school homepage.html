    <h1>St Huxley's Community College</h1>
    <p>Brave new world</p>
    <p>It's a brave new world out there. Our children are being put in increasingly more competitive situations, both during recreation, and as they start to move into the adult world of examinations, jobs, careers, and other life choices. Having the wrong mindset, becoming too emotional, or making the wrong choices can contribute to them experiencing difficulty in taking their rightful place in today's ideal society.</p>
